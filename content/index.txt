  %p It's one thing to have a quality coder... It's quite another to have a genius consultant that views a project from top to bottom before he writes even a line of code to make sure every angle and possible issue/problem has been addressed. And even then (because a client always thinks of something after-the-fact!), Sourcescape was still flexible in providing solutions to make sure we were happy.
